# BitLab Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating BitLab's capabilities.

## Getting Started

Try the initial version of BitLab with our MLP example:

- **[MLP Training](mlp/)** - Complete training example with MNIST dataset

## Running Examples

```bash
# MLP training example
python docs/examples/mlp/training.py
```

## Current Examples

### MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
- **[Training](mlp/training.py)** - Train a BitLinear MLP on MNIST
- **[README](mlp/README.md)** - Detailed MLP documentation

## What's Coming

Stay tuned for more examples featuring:
- **Language Models** - GPT, BERT, LLaMA with BitLinear
- **Vision Models** - ResNet, ViT, CLIP implementations  
- **Multimodal Models** - CLIP, BLIP with quantized attention
- **Advanced Benchmarks** - Performance comparisons and analysis

## Example Structure

Each example includes:
- Clear documentation and comments
- Step-by-step explanations
- Performance comparisons
- Memory usage analysis

## Requirements

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision rich
```

## Next Steps

After running the examples:
1. Try modifying the configurations
2. Experiment with different model architectures
3. Explore the API reference for more advanced usage
4. Check back for new examples as we add them!
